# Decision Tree Algorithm

## Introduction

A **Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is a tree-like structure where internal nodes represent features, branches represent decision rules, and leaf nodes represent outcomes.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Structure of a Decision Tree

- **Root Node**: Represents the entire dataset and the first split.
- **Internal Nodes**: Represent decision points based on feature values.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Represent class labels or regression outputs.
- **Branches**: Represent decision rules leading to child nodes.

### 2. Types of Decision Trees

- **Classification Tree**: Used when the target variable is categorical.
- **Regression Tree**: Used when the target variable is continuous.

### 3. Splitting Criteria

Decision Trees use impurity measures to determine the best split:

- **Gini Impurity**: Measures how often a randomly chosen element would be incorrectly classified.
- **Entropy (Information Gain)**: Measures the uncertainty in the dataset.
- **Variance Reduction**: Used in regression trees to minimize variance in target values.

### 4. Tree Pruning

To prevent overfitting, trees are pruned using:

- **Pre-pruning** (early stopping): Stops the tree from growing beyond a certain depth.
- **Post-pruning**: Removes branches that provide little predictive power based on a validation set.

### 5. Handling Overfitting

- Limit the **maximum depth** of the tree.
- Set a **minimum number of samples** required for a split.
- Use **cross-validation** to tune hyperparameters.
- Implement **pruning** techniques.

### 6. Advantages of Decision Trees

- Simple to understand and interpret.
- Requires little data preprocessing (no need for feature scaling).
- Handles both numerical and categorical data.
- Works well with missing values.

### 7. Disadvantages of Decision Trees

- Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
- Can be unstable due to small variations in data.
- May not perform well on highly complex relationships (better suited for ensemble methods like Random Forests).

### 8. Popular Decision Tree Algorithms

- **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)**: Uses information gain as the splitting criterion.
- **C4.5**: Extension of ID3 that handles both categorical and continuous data.
- **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)**: Uses Gini impurity for classification and variance reduction for regression.
- **CHAID (Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector)**: Uses statistical tests to determine splits.
